/**
 * A note about the MSVC warning C4251:
 * This warning should be suppressed for private data members of the project's
 * exported classes, because there are too many ways to work around it and all
 * involve some kind of trade-off (increased code complexity requiring more
 * developer time, writing boilerplate code, longer compile times), but those
 * solutions are very situational and solve things in slightly different ways,
 * depending on the requirements of the project.
 * That is to say, there is no general solution.
 *
 * What can be done instead is understand where issues could arise where this
 * warning is spotting a legitimate bug. I will give the general description of
 * this warning's cause and break it down to make it trivial to understand.
 *
 * C4251 is emitted when an exported class has a non-static data member of a
 * non-exported class type.
 *
 * The exported class in our case is the class below (exported_class), which
 * has a non-static data member (m_name) of a non-exported class type
 * (std::string).
 *
 * The rationale here is that the user of the exported class could attempt to
 * access (directly, or via an inline member function) a static data member or
 * a non-inline member function of the data member, resulting in a linker
 * error.
 * Inline member function above means member functions that are defined (not
 * declared) in the class definition.
 *
 * Since this exported class never makes these non-exported types available to
 * the user, we can safely ignore this warning. It's fine if there are
 * non-exported class types as private member variables, because they are only
 * accessed by the members of the exported class itself.
 *
 * The name() method below returns a pointer to the stored null-terminated
 * string as a fundamental type (char const), so this is safe to use anywhere.
 * The only downside is that you can have dangling pointers if the pointer
 * outlives the class instance which stored the string.
 *
 * Shared libraries are not easy, they need some discipline to get right, but
 * they also solve some other problems that make them worth the time invested.
