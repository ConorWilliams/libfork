  A bleeding edge, lock-free, wait-free, continuation-stealing coroutine-tasking library.

<h3 align="center"> ** Now with üåµ **  </h1>

`libfork` is primarily an abstraction for strict [fork-join parallelism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork%E2%80%93join_model). This is made possible without the use of any macros/inline assembly using C++20's coroutines. Ultra-fine grained parallelism (the ability to spawn tasks with near zero overhead) is enabled by an innovative implementation of a non-allocating [cactus-stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent_pointer_tree) that utilizes _stack-stealing_.

__TLDR:__
```c++

inline constexpr async fib = [](auto fib, int n) -> lf::task<int> { 
  
  if (n < 2) {
    co_return n;
  }

  int a, b

  co_await lf::fork[a, fib](n - 1);    // Spawn a child task.
  co_await lf::call[b, fib](n - 2);    // Execute inline.

  co_await lf::join;                   // Wait for children.

  co_return a + b;                     // Safe to access after join.
};
```

`libfork` presents a cross-platform API that decouples scheduling tasks (a customization point) from writing tasks and expressing their dependencies. Additionally, `libfork` provides performant NUMA-aware work-stealing schedulers for general use. 




## Benchmarks

See the [benchmark's README](benchmark/README.md) for a comparison of `libfork` to openMP and Intel's TBB, as well as some ARM/weak-memory-model benchmarks. 

## Building and installing

See the [BUILDING](BUILDING.md) document for full details on compilation, installation and optional dependencies.

<h4 align="center"> ‚ö†Ô∏è COMPILER NIGGLES ‚ö†Ô∏è </h4>

- __gcc__ `libfork` is tested on versions 11.x-13.x however gcc [does not perform a guaranteed tail call](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=100897) for coroutine's symmetric transfer unless compiling with optimization greater than or equal to `-O2` and sanitizers are not in use. This will result in stack overflows for some programs in un-optimized builds. 

- __clang__ `libfork` compiles on versions 15.x-17.x however for versions 16.x and below bugs [#63022](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/63022) and [#47179](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/47179) will cause crashes for optimized builds in multithreaded programs. We work around this in these versions by isolating access to `thread_local` storage in non-inlined functions however, this introduces around a 25% performance penalty vs GCC.

- __msvc__ `libfork` compiles on versions 19.35-19.37 however due to [this bug](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Incorrect-code-generation-for-symmetric/1659260?scope=follow) (duplicate [here](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Using-symmetric-transfer-and-coroutine_h/10251975?scope=follow&q=symmetric)) it will always seg-fault due to an erroneous double delete.

### Tasks and futures

The tasking fork-join interface is designed to mirror Cilk and other fork-join frameworks. With libfork the canonical recursive-Fibonacci is a simple as:

```c++
#include "libfork/libfork.hpp"
#include "libfork/schedule/busy.hpp"

/// Compute the n'th fibonacci number
inline constexpr auto fib = lf::async([](auto fib, int n) -> lf::task<int> { 

  if (n < 2) {
    co_return n;
  }

  int a, b

  co_await lf::fork[a, fib](n - 1);    // Spawn a child task.
  co_await lf::call[b, fib](n - 2);    // Execute inline.

  co_await lf::join;                   // Wait for children.

  co_return a + b;                     // Safe to access after join
});
```
which can be launched on the ``busy_pool`` scheduler as follows:
```c++
lf::busy thread_pool(num_threads);

int fib_10 = lf::wait(thread_pool, fib, 10);
```
Note:
- Tasks **must** join **before** returning or dereferencing a future.
- Futures **must** join in their parent task.

The mental execution model here is: 
1. At ``auto a = co_await fib(n - 1).fork()`` the parent/current task is suspended and a child task is spawned, ``a`` is of type ``basic_future<int, busy_pool::context>``. 
2. The current thread pushes the parent task's continuation onto its execution-context and starts executing the child task; the scheduler is free to hand the parent task's continuation to another thread.
3. At ``auto b = co_await fib(n - 2)`` a new child task is spawned and the current thread immediately starts executing it. The continuation is not pushed onto the execution-context. This is preferred to ``.fork()`` as a thieving thread would have no work to do before the ``join()``.
4. At ``co_await lf::join()``, if the children have not completed, the parent task is suspended.
5. The parent task will be resumed by the thread which completes the final child task.

Hence, at every ``co_await`` the thread executing the parent task may change! This is a diamond-shaped dependency graph, where the parent task is the diamond's tip and the children are the diamond's legs. The diamond's base is the continuation following the ``join()``. In this case the children may be recursively more complex sub-graphs. Crucially, the task graph encodes to the scheduler that: the children may be executed in parallel; the children must complete before the parent task can continue past the ``join()``.

## Schedulers

A scheduler is responsible for distributing available work (tasks) to physical CPUs/executors. Each executor must own an execution-context object satisfying:
```c++
template <typename T>
concept context = requires(T context, work_handle<T> task) {
    { context.push(task) } -> std::same_as<void>;
    { context.pop() } -> std::convertible_to<std::optional<work_handle<T>>>;
};
```
An execution-context models a FILO stack. Tasks hold a pointer to their executor's context and push/pop tasks onto it. Whilst an executor is running a task, other executors can steal from the top of the stack in a FIFO manner. 

It is recommended that custom schedulers use lock-free stacks for their execution contexts such as the one provided in [libfork](include/libfork/deque.hpp)
