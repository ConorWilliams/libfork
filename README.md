Libfork (üç¥) is primarily an abstraction for lock-free, wait-free, continuation-stealing [fork-join parallelism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork%E2%80%93join_model). This is made possible without the use of any macros/inline assembly using C++20's coroutines. Libfork presents an API that decouples scheduling tasks (a customisation point) from writing tasks and expressing their dependencies. Secondarily, libfork provides a performant work-stealing scheduler for general use.

# Building and installing

See the [BUILDING](BUILDING.md) document.

# Tasking

The tasking fork-join interface is designed to mirror Cilk.

# Scheduling

# Benchmarks

# API reference
