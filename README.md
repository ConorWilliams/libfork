Libfork is primarily an abstraction for lock-free, wait-free, continuation-stealing [fork-join parallelism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork%E2%80%93join_model). This is made possible without the use of any macros/inline assembly using C++20's coroutines. Libfork presents an API that decouples scheduling tasks (a customization point) from writing tasks and expressing their dependencies. Secondarily, libfork provides a performant work-stealing scheduler for general use.

# Building and installing

See the [BUILDING](BUILDING.md) document.

# Tasking

The tasking fork-join interface is designed to mirror Cilk and other fork-join frameworks. With libfork the canonical recursive-Fibonacci is a simple as:

```c++
/// Compute the n'th fibonacci number
template<typename Context>
auto fib(int n) -> basic_task<int, Context> { 

  if (n < 2) {
    co_return n;
  }

  auto a = co_await fib(n - 1).fork(); // Spawn a child task.
  auto b = co_await fib(n - 2);        // Execute inline.

  co_await lf::join();                 // Wait for children.

  co_return *a + b;                    // Use * to deference a future.
}
```

Which can be launched on a scheduler of your choice (such as libfork's ``busy_pool``):

```c++
lf::busy_pool pool;

int fib_10 = pool.schedule(fib(10));
```
